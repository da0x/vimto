# vimto

This is the personal vimrc for Daher Alfawares.

My approach is minimalist behavior and full visual beauty. Give it a shot.

To install
```
git clone https://github.com/da0x/vimto.git ~/.vimto
```
Then add the following to your `.vimrc`
```
vim ~/.vimrc
```
Insert the following line:
source ~/.vimto/vimto.vim
```
