# vimto

This is the personal vimrc for Daher Alfawares.

My approach is minimalist behavior and full visual beauty. Give it a shot.

To install
```
git clone https://github.com/da0x/vimto.git ~/.vimto
echo source ~/.vimto/vimto.vim << ~/.vimrc
```

Install Vim Plug: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

Run:
```
:PlugInstall
```
